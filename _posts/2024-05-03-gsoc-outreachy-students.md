title: Google Summer of Code and Outreachy Students 2024
---

We are happy to announce that MDAnalysis is hosting three [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] (GSoC) contributors - [@ljwoods2](https://github.com/ljwoods2), [@talagayev](https://github.com/talagayev) and [@lunamorrow](https://github.com/lunamorrow) - and an [Outreachy][outreachy] intern - [@adetutudeborah](https://github.com/adetutudeborah). MDAnalysis has been accepted as its own [organization with GSoC][mda-gsoc] for the fifth year running, and we are excited to be hosting our second-ever [MDAnalysis Outreachy internship](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/2024-05/). We are grateful to Google and Outreachy for granting us the opportunity to get started on _four_ very exciting projects!

# GSoC

## Lawson Woods: [Enhancing the Interoperability and Efficiency of the Zarrtraj MDAKit](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/BYYAE9MR)

2D Visualization of small molecules is quite a helpful way to recognize the different parts of the small molecule. The main objective of Valerij's GSOC project will revolve around the 2D visualization of small molecules through the application of the MDAnalysis RDKit converter, which would allow to convert ligands into RDKit objects and thus allow the user to look at the ligand in his MDAnalysis Universe in an easy to use interactive display in jupyter notebook.

Valerij is a pharmacy student, who graduated at the University of Marburg, there he worked at the [Kolb Lab](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb16/ipc/kolb-group). Valerij is currently a PhD student at the Free University of Berlin at the [Wolber Lab]([https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb16/ipc/kolb-group](https://www.bcp.fu-berlin.de/en/pharmazie/faecher/pharmazeutische_chemie/wolber/index.html)) with his research revolving around Toll-like receptor antagonists with addition to method development such as [OpenMMDL](https://github.com/wolberlab/OpenMMDL).

You can find Valerij on Github as [talagayev](https://github.com/talagayev) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valerij-talagayev-260bb820b). To see the updates on the 2D visualization of small molecules project follow his [blog](https://talagayev.github.io/).
