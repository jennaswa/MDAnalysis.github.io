title: Google Summer of Code Students 2025
---

We are proud to announce that MDAnalysis — in [collaboration with Molecular Nodes, ProLIF, and WESTPA](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/GSoC-2025-Project-Ideas#collaborations) — 
is hosting _four_ [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] (GSoC) contributors: @jpkrowe, @nilay-v3rma, @PardhavMaradani, and @yuyuan871111. MDAnalysis has been accepted as its own [organization with GSoC][mda-gsoc] 
for the sixth year in a row. We are grateful to Google for granting us the opportunity to get started on these four very exciting projects!

## Pardhav Maradani: [Better Interfacing of Blender and MDAnalysis](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/9BR8jbvV)

MDAnalysis has a basic interface with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) through a popular extension called [Molecular Nodes](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes), which allows importing MDAnalysis universes and provides advanced rendering capabilities through a GUI. The ability to script and support advanced visualizations of MDAnalysis results is currently limited. This project attempts to define, prototype and implement various APIs along with an integrated GUI within Blender as part of [GGMolVis](https://github.com/yuxuanzhuang/ggmolvis) and [Molecular Nodes](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes) that will together provide advanced visualization capabilities for MDAnalysis.

Pardhav is an undergraduate student from India pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology (Vellore) and a BS in Data Science and Applications from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.

You can find Pardhav on GitHub [@PardhavMaradani](https://github.com/PardhavMaradani).
